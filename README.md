## Introduction

The **Attendance Management System with Face Recognition** is a Python-based project that automates the attendance-taking process using facial recognition technology. This system allows you to register individuals by capturing their facial features and then recognize them during online meetings to track attendance.

Attendance management is a crucial task in various settings, including educational institutions, corporate meetings, and conferences. This project simplifies and streamlines the attendance tracking process by eliminating the need for manual record-keeping.

## Features

- **Facial Registration:** Register users by capturing their facial features for a specified number of frames (e.g., 100 frames) and save their profiles under their respective names.
- **Face Recognition:** Utilize a trained machine learning model to recognize registered users' faces in real-time.
- **Online Meeting Integration:** Easily integrate the system with online meeting platforms to automate attendance tracking.
- **Customizable:** Adapt the system to different settings and scenarios with configurable parameters.
- **User-friendly:** A straightforward interface for both registration and attendance tracking.


## Installation
